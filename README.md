The sales performance project involves analyzing and visualizing a company's sales data to identify trends, top-performing areas, and potential improvements. It integrates data from various sources such as CRM systems, e-commerce platforms, and financial records to provide a comprehensive view of sales metrics like total sales, growth rates, and customer acquisition costs.

The project aims to create an interactive dashboard using BI tools like Power BI to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) across different dimensions, including regions, products, and sales channels. This dashboard facilitates quick comparisons and detailed analyses, helping stakeholders make informed decisions to optimize sales strategies, forecast future trends, and align with business goals.

Regular monitoring and updates ensure the dashboard remains relevant and actionable.
